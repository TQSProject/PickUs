# TQS 2023 Project: PickUs

# Abstract

PickUs is a solution for managing deliveries of products and managing delivery points.

Any external store can use our solution to manage their product delivery.

Registered ACPs (Associated Collection Point) have their own dashboard to manage their orders, and PickUs admins have a dedicated dashboard too.

Separately, we also have a web store where end users can buy products and have them delivered to an ACP.
